Homework 2 due 9/2/14

My program will read in a .csv file with state names and abreviations and store them in a linked list. 
It is commented using the Google C++ Style Guide (Revision 3.274). 
You can find this style guide at: 

http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml

In the HW02 folder you will find the following files:
driverProgram.cpp   This file is the driver program 
StatesLinkList.h  	This file is the header for ^
README.md 			This file is itself...
States.csv 			This file contains the input data

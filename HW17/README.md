Project 2 Web API:

#Proposal:
For this project will create a database of school events that can interfaced with a website. Our API will allow users to perform basic CRUD operations on a remote database. 
We plan to make a way for users to sort and get events based on a few key value pairs. For example type of event, date of event, or who is hosting the event.  The database will also have the functionality to let users create and update events.
Our web application will be able to interact with postman to give in-depth json files that respond to user requests.    

For preliminary requests we will have different user queries such as the Get request, where a user can get the whole list of events or any list there of based on theirs search parameters.  The create request would allow the user to create a new event and specify the events details in a key value pair style format. Functionality for updating and deleting events can be made available in the future, but would require a user based authentications system for security.

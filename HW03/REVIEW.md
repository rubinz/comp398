peer reviewing 

Part 1:
The style guide seemes to have been followed very well. 
Source code was well spaced, organized and most variable 
names were logical and easy to distinguish. 
Files were named correctly, and overall structure seemed good.

Part2:
The parameters and styling were perfect. Nothing to be changed
if you ask me. The only change I might make is to include the 
linked_list.cpp in the main.cpp function so that I wouldnt need
to compile both the main and linked_list at the same time to get 
them to compile. Other than that a very good job.

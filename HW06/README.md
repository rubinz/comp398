the wcag 2.0 guidelines are meant to make all web information universally available for any person to use. these criteria are not required, but are necessary to make your sites more accessible. 

unfortunately my new Wheaton Course Schedule isnt quite ready to be fully accessible, and theirfore I feel it is more okay that my site doesnt abide by all the guidelines of wcag.

I hope that if there are any failures in my site that people report them to me so I can look into resolving them.

in terms of my schedules code status:
									I have not yet created a working way to extract the schedule data from the wheaton course schedule, so i have generously provided some example data samples in the schedule.

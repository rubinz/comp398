	This is my folder and initial files for HW08. 
	I still havent gotten my scraper working, and will need to manually gather the info from the course schedule.
	I will also need to find some sort of outline to base my design off of.

									I have not yet created a working way to extract the schedule data from the wheaton course schedule, so i have generously provided some example data samples in the schedule.

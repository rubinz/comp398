(in pharagraph): This is my readme file in md. Im bad at md, so this will be brief. I have been working on getting my python up to spock. I havent done much python since leblanc taught it, and obviously his python wasnt the same level as yours. at one point I had the h1 converter working. the concept for the code should all be here for <p> and <h>, its just not working atm. Ill keep fiddling with it and see if I can get these two operators working well.
